2
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
 This is the Asgardian refugee vessel Statesman.
3
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
 We are under assault. I repeat, we are under assault.
4
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
 The engines are dead, life support failing.
5
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
 Requesting aid from any vessel within range.
6
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
 We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.
7
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
 Our crew is made up of Asgardian families.
8
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
 We have very few soldiers here.
9
00:00:52 --> 00:00:56
 This is not a warcraft. I repeat, this is not a warcraft.
10
00:01:09 --> 00:01:12
 Hear me and rejoice.
11
00:01:16 --> 00:01:21
 You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan.
12
00:01:24 --> 00:01:26
 You may think this is suffering.
13
00:01:27 --> 00:01:28
 No.
14
00:01:29 --> 00:01:32
 It is salvation.
15
00:01:36 --> 00:01:41
 Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice.
16
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
 Smile.
17
00:01:45 --> 00:01:50
 For even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.
18
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
 I know what it's like to lose.
19
00:02:10 --> 00:02:13
 To feel so desperately that you're right...
20
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
 yet to fail, nonetheless.
21
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
 It's frightening.
22
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
 Turns the legs to jelly.
23
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
 But I ask you, to what end?
24
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
 Dread it, run from it...
25
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
 destiny arrives all the same.
26
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
 And now, it's here.
27
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
 Or should I say...
28
00:02:48 --> 00:02:49
 I am.
29
00:02:55 --> 00:02:56
 You talk too much.
30
00:02:58 --> 00:02:59
 The Tesseract.
31
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
 Or your brother's head.
32
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
 I assume you have a preference.
33
00:03:10 --> 00:03:11
 Oh, I do.
34
00:03:13 --> 00:03:14
 Kill away.
35
00:03:30 --> 00:03:31
 All right, stop!
36
00:03:34 --> 00:03:36
 We don't have the Tesseract.
37
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
 It was destroyed on Asgard.
38
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
 You really are the worst brother.
39
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
 I assure you, brother...
40
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
 the sun will shine on us again.
41
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
 Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.
42
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
 Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian.
43
00:04:11 --> 00:04:12
 And for another...
44
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
 we have a Hulk.
45
00:04:28 --> 00:04:29
 Let him have his fun.
46
00:05:22 --> 00:05:23
 Allfathers...
47
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
 let the dark magic flow through me one last...
48
00:05:29 --> 00:05:30
 time.
49
00:05:45 --> 00:05:46
 That was a mistake.
50
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
 No!
51
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
 You're going to die for that.
52
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
 My humble personage...
53
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
 bows before your grandeur.
54
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
 No other being has ever had the might...
55
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
 nay, the nobility...
56
00:06:31 --> 00:06:36
 to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones.
57
00:06:40 --> 00:06:44
 The universe lies within your grasp.
58
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
 There are two more stones on Earth.
59
00:07:27 --> 00:07:31
 Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.
60
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
 Father, we will not fail you.
61
00:07:33 --> 00:07:34
 If I might interject.
62
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
 If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide.
63
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
 I do have a bit of experience in that arena.
64
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
 If you consider failure experience.
65
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
 I consider experience experience.
66
00:07:49 --> 00:07:50
 Almighty Thanos...
67
00:07:51 --> 00:07:55
 I, Loki, prince of Asgard...
68
00:07:59 --> 00:08:00
 Odinson...
69
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
 the rightful king of Jotunheim...
70
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
 god of mischief...
71
00:08:10 --> 00:08:11
 do hereby pledge to you...
72
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
 my undying fidelity.
73
00:08:27 --> 00:08:28
 Undying?
74
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
 You should choose your words more carefully.
75
00:08:40 --> 00:08:50

76
00:08:56 --> 00:08:57
 You...
77
00:08:59 --> 00:09:00
 will never be...
78
00:09:03 --> 00:09:04
 a god.
79
00:09:14 --> 00:09:15
 No!
80
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
 No resurrections this time.
81
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
 No. Loki.
82
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
 Seriously, you don't have any money?
83
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
 Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.
84
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
 I'll tell the guys at the deli.
85
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
 Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.
86
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
 Wait, wait, wait. I think I have 200.
87
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
 Dollars?
88
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
 - Rupees. - Which is?
89
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
 Buck and a half.
90
00:10:54 --> 00:10:55
 What do you want?
91
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
 I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.
92
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
 Thanos is coming.
93
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
 He's coming.
94
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
 Who?
95
00:11:28 --> 00:11:29
 Slow down, slow down.
96
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
 - I'll spell it out for you. No, I'm not. - You're totally rambling. You lost me.
97
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
 Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee.
98
00:11:34 --> 00:11:35
 - Yeah. - Okay.
99
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
 And then you're like, "Oh, my God. There's no bathrooms. What am I gonna do?
100
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
 - "Oh, someone's watching." - Right.
101
00:11:39 --> 00:11:40
 - "I'm gonna go in my pants." - And then you wake up...
102
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
 and in real life you actually have to pee.
103
00:11:42 --> 00:11:43
 - Yes. - Yeah.
104
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
 - Okay. - Everybody has that.
105
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
 Right, that's the point I'm trying to make.
106
00:11:47 --> 00:11:51
 Apropos of that, last night I dreamt we had a kid.
107
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
 It was so real.
108
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
 We named him after your eccentric uncle. What was his name?
109
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
 - Right. - Morgan! Morgan.
110
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
 - So you woke up... - Naturally.
111
00:12:00 --> 00:12:01
 ...and thought that we were...
112
00:12:02 --> 00:12:03
 - Expecting. - Yeah.
113
00:12:03 --> 00:12:04
 - Yes? - No.
114
00:12:04 --> 00:12:05
 I had a dream about it. It was so real.
115
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
 If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that.
116
00:12:10 --> 00:12:11
 I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing.
117
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
 It's just a housing unit for nanoparticles.
118
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
 - You're not helping your case, okay? - No, this is detachable. It's not a...
119
00:12:16 --> 00:12:17
 You don't need that.
120
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
 I know, I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us...
121
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
 and future usses and that's it.
122
00:12:22 --> 00:12:23
 Just in case there's a monster in the closet.
123
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
 - Instead of, you know... - Shirts.
124
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
 You know me so well.
125
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
 - God. - You finish all my sentences.
126
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
 You should have shirts in your closet.
127
00:12:34 --> 00:12:35
 Yeah.
128
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
 You know what there should be? No more surprises.
129
00:12:38 --> 00:12:39
 We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight.
130
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
 Show off this Harry Winston.
131
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
 Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever.
132
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
 I should promise you.
133
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
 - Yes. - I will.
134
00:12:49 --> 00:12:50
 Thank you.
135
00:12:50 --> 00:12:51
 Tony Stark.
136
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
 I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me.
137
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
 Congratulations on the wedding, by the way.
138
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
 I'm sorry, you giving out tickets to something?
139
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
 We need your help.
140
00:13:03 --> 00:13:07
 It's not overselling it to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.
141
00:13:07 --> 00:13:08
 And who's "we"?
142
00:13:10 --> 00:13:11
 Hey, Tony.
143
00:13:11 --> 00:13:12
 Bruce.
144
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
 - Pepper. - Hi.
145
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
 You okay?
146
00:13:20 --> 00:13:24
 At the dawn of the universe, there was nothing.
147
00:13:24 --> 00:13:25
 Then...
148
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
 The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals...
149
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
 hurtling across the virgin universe.
150
00:13:34 --> 00:13:39
 These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence.
151
00:13:40 --> 00:13:41
 Space.
152
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
 Reality.
153
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
 Power.
154
00:13:47 --> 00:13:48
 Soul.
155
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
 Mind.
156
00:13:53 --> 00:13:54
 And Time.
157
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
 Tell me his name again.
158
00:14:05 --> 00:14:06
 Thanos.
159
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
 He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants.
160
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
 He wipes out half the population.
161
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
 He sent Loki.
162
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
 The attack on New York, that's him.
163
00:14:18 --> 00:14:19
 This is it.
164
00:14:20 --> 00:14:21
 What's our timeline?
165
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
 No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones.
166
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
 That already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe.
167
00:14:26 --> 00:14:29
 If he gets his hands on all six stones, Tony...
168
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
 He could destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.
169
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
 Did you seriously just say "hitherto undreamt of"?
170
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
 Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
171
00:14:37 --> 00:14:38
 Is that what it is?
172
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
 I'm going to allow that.
173
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
 If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down a garbage disposal?
174
00:14:49 --> 00:14:50
 No can do.
175
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
 We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone with our lives.
176
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
 And I swore off dairy, but then Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me.
177
00:14:57 --> 00:14:58
 - Stark Raving Hazelnuts. - Not bad.
178
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
 A bit chalky.
179
00:15:00 --> 00:15:01
 A Hunk of Hulk of Burning Fudge is our favorite.
180
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
 - That's a thing? - Whatever. Point is, things change.
181
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
 Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change.
182
00:15:07 --> 00:15:09
 And this stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.
183
00:15:09 --> 00:15:12
 Yeah, so conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.
184
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
 Well, if we don't do our jobs.
185
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
 What is your job exactly? Besides making balloon animals.
186
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
 Protecting your reality, douchebag.
187
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
 Okay, guys. Could we table this discussion right now?
188
00:15:23 --> 00:15:26
 The fact is we have this stone. We know where it is.
189
00:15:27 --> 00:15:31
 Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone and we have to find him now.
190
00:15:32 --> 00:15:33
 Yeah, that's the thing.
191
00:15:33 --> 00:15:34
 What do you mean?
192
00:15:34 --> 00:15:38
 Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.
193
00:15:38 --> 00:15:39
 - What? - Yeah.
194
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
 Tony, you lost another super-bot?
195
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
 I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.
196
00:15:44 --> 00:15:45
 Who could find Vision then?
197
00:15:48 --> 00:15:49
 Shit.
198
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
 Probably Steve Rogers.
199
00:15:51 --> 00:15:52
 Oh, great.
200
00:15:53 --> 00:15:54
 Maybe.
201
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
 But...
202
00:15:59 --> 00:16:00
 Call him.
203
00:16:01 --> 00:16:02
 It's not that easy.
204
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
 God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?
205
00:16:05 --> 00:16:06
 No.
206
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
 The Avengers broke up. We're toast.
207
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
 Broke up?
208
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
 Like a band? Like the Beatles?
209
00:16:14 --> 00:16:15
 Cap and I fell out hard.
210
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
 We're not on speaking terms.
211
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
 Tony, listen to me.
212
00:16:23 --> 00:16:24
 Thor's gone.
213
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
 Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.
214
00:16:46 --> 00:16:47
 Flip phone.
215
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
 Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would ya?
216
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
 Not at the moment, no.
217
00:17:46 --> 00:17:48
 You okay?
218
00:17:49 --> 00:17:50
 - Help him! - Banner!
219
00:17:50 --> 00:17:52
 - Wong! Look alive! - Go, go! We got it!
220
00:17:52 --> 00:17:53
 Friday, what am I looking at?
221
00:17:53 --> 00:17:55
 Not sure. I'm working on it.
222
00:17:55 --> 00:17:58
 Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!
223
00:17:58 --> 00:18:00
 Might wanna use it.
224
00:18:27 --> 00:18:29
 Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.
225
00:18:29 --> 00:18:31
 Holy shit.
226
00:18:31 --> 00:18:33
 We're all gonna die!
227
00:18:33 --> 00:18:34
 There's a spaceship!
228
00:18:34 --> 00:18:36
 - What's going on? - Oh, my God!
229
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
 What's the matter with you kids? You never seen a spaceship before?
230
00:19:00 --> 00:19:03
 Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd Street. Notify first responders.
231
00:19:03 --> 00:19:04
 Will do.
232
00:19:33 --> 00:19:36
 Hear me and rejoice.
233
00:19:37 --> 00:19:41
 You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos.
234
00:19:42 --> 00:19:46
 Be thankful that your meaningless lives are now contributing...
235
00:19:46 --> 00:19:49
 I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.
236
00:19:49 --> 00:19:52
 You better pack it up and get outta here.
237
00:19:52 --> 00:19:53
 Stonekeeper.
238
00:19:54 --> 00:19:56
 Does this chattering animal speak for you?
239
00:19:57 --> 00:19:58
 Certainly not. I speak for myself.
240
00:19:59 --> 00:20:01
 You're trespassing in this city and on this planet.
241
00:20:02 --> 00:20:04
 He means get lost, Squidward.
242
00:20:04 --> 00:20:05
 He exhausts me.
243
00:20:06 --> 00:20:07
 Bring me the stone.
244
00:20:09 --> 00:20:10
 Banner, you want a piece?
245
00:20:12 --> 00:20:14
 No, not really. But when do I ever get what I want?
246
00:20:14 --> 00:20:15
 That's right.
247
00:20:16 --> 00:20:17
 Okay. Push!
248
00:20:17 --> 00:20:19
 It's been a while.
249
00:20:19 --> 00:20:20
 It's gonna be good to have you, buddy.
250
00:20:21 --> 00:20:21
 Okay.
251
00:20:22 --> 00:20:24
 Let me just... I need to concentrate here for a second.
252
00:20:25 --> 00:20:26
 Come on, come on, man.
253
00:20:27 --> 00:20:28
 God!
254
00:20:29 --> 00:20:31
 Where's your guy?
255
00:20:32 --> 00:20:33
 I don't know. We've sorta been having a thing.
256
00:20:34 --> 00:20:35
 - It's no time for a thing. - I know.
257
00:20:35 --> 00:20:36
 That's the thing right there. Let's go.
258
00:20:43 --> 00:20:45
 Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.
259
00:20:45 --> 00:20:47
 Tony, I'm sorry. Either I can't or he won't.
260
00:20:47 --> 00:20:48
 It's okay.
261
00:20:48 --> 00:20:50
 Hey, stand down. Keep an eye on him. Thank you.
262
00:20:50 --> 00:20:52
 - I have him. - Damn it.
263
00:21:19 --> 00:21:21
 Where'd that come from?
264
00:21:21 --> 00:21:23
 It's nanotech. You like it? A little something I...
265
00:21:27 --> 00:21:30
 Doctor Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us...
266
00:21:40 --> 00:21:41
 Gotta get that stone outta here, now.
267
00:21:41 --> 00:21:43
 It stays with me.
268
00:21:43 --> 00:21:44
 Exactly. Bye.
269
00:21:53 --> 00:21:55
 Tony, you okay?
270
00:21:55 --> 00:21:56
 How we doing? Good? Bad?
271
00:21:56 --> 00:21:58
 Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?
272
00:21:58 --> 00:21:59
 I'm trying. He won't come out.
273
00:22:01 --> 00:22:02
 Hammer.
274
00:22:10 --> 00:22:13
 Come on, Hulk! What are you doing to me?
275
00:22:13 --> 00:22:15
 Come out! Come out! Come out!
276
00:22:16 --> 00:22:18
 No!
277
00:22:22 --> 00:22:23
 What do you mean, "no"?
278
00:22:29 --> 00:22:31
 Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?
279
00:22:31 --> 00:22:34
 - Kid, where'd you come from? - A field trip to MoMA.
280
00:22:36 --> 00:22:37
 What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?
281
00:22:39 --> 00:22:41
 He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.
282
00:23:08 --> 00:23:12
 Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.
283
00:23:15 --> 00:23:17
 It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.
284
00:23:17 --> 00:23:19
 Then I'll take it off your corpse.
285
00:23:32 --> 00:23:37
 You'll find removing a dead man's spell troublesome.
286
00:23:37 --> 00:23:39
 You'll only wish you were dead.
287
00:23:49 --> 00:23:50
 No!
288
00:23:54 --> 00:23:56
 Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
289
00:23:56 --> 00:23:57
 On it!
290
00:24:05 --> 00:24:06
 Not cool.
291
00:24:10 --> 00:24:11
 Gotcha!
292
00:24:13 --> 00:24:14
 Wait!
293
00:24:21 --> 00:24:24
 Mr. Stark, I'm being beamed up.
294
00:24:24 --> 00:24:26
 Hang on, kid.
295
00:24:46 --> 00:24:47
 Wong, you're invited to my wedding.
296
00:24:55 --> 00:24:56
 Give me a little juice, Friday.
297
00:25:05 --> 00:25:06
 Unlock 17:A.
298
00:25:19 --> 00:25:21
 Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.
299
00:25:21 --> 00:25:23
 But you said save the wizard!
300
00:25:24 --> 00:25:25
 I can't breathe.
301
00:25:26 --> 00:25:28
 We're too high up. You're running out of air.
302
00:25:29 --> 00:25:31
 Yeah. That makes sense.
303
00:25:48 --> 00:25:50
 Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!
304
00:25:50 --> 00:25:51
 Happy trails, kid.
305
00:25:51 --> 00:25:53
 - Friday, send him home. - Yep.
306
00:25:54 --> 00:25:55
 Oh, come on!
307
00:26:04 --> 00:26:06
 Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.
308
00:26:06 --> 00:26:08
 Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?
309
00:26:08 --> 00:26:11
 Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.
310
00:26:11 --> 00:26:12
 Why?
311
00:26:12 --> 00:26:15
 Just 'cause I'll probably not make it back for a while.
312
00:26:16 --> 00:26:17
 Tell me you're not on that ship.
313
00:26:17 --> 00:26:18
 Yeah.
314
00:26:18 --> 00:26:20
 God, no, please tell me you're not on the ship.
315
00:26:20 --> 00:26:21
 Honey, I'm sorry.
316
00:26:22 --> 00:26:24
 - I'm sorry, I don't know what to say. - Come back here, Tony. I swear to God.
317
00:26:24 --> 00:26:26
 - Pep. - Come back here right now.
318
00:26:27 --> 00:26:28
 Come back.
319
00:26:28 --> 00:26:30
 Boss, we're losing her.
320
00:26:30 --> 00:26:32
 I'm going too.
321
00:26:41 --> 00:26:42
 Oh, my God!
322
00:26:47 --> 00:26:49
 I shoulda stayed on the bus.
323
00:27:03 --> 00:27:04
 Where you going?
324
00:27:05 --> 00:27:06
 The Time Stone's been taken.
325
00:27:06 --> 00:27:08
 The Sanctum remains unguarded.
326
00:27:09 --> 00:27:10
 What will you do?
327
00:27:11 --> 00:27:13
 I'm gonna make a call.
328
00:27:53 --> 00:27:54
 Sing it, Drax!
329
00:28:07 --> 00:28:08
 Why are we doing this again?
330
00:28:08 --> 00:28:11
 It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.
331
00:28:11 --> 00:28:13
 I get that, but why are we doing it?
332
00:28:13 --> 00:28:15
 'Cause we're nice.
333
00:28:15 --> 00:28:18
 And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our effort.
334
00:28:18 --> 00:28:21
 - Which isn't the point. - Which isn't the point.
335
00:28:21 --> 00:28:22
 I mean, if he doesn't pony up...
336
00:28:23 --> 00:28:24
 We take his ship.
337
00:28:24 --> 00:28:25
 - Exactly! - Bingo!
338
00:28:26 --> 00:28:26
 All right!
339
00:28:30 --> 00:28:31
 We are arriving.
340
00:28:32 --> 00:28:34
 All right, Guardians, don't forget this might be dangerous...
341
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
 so let's put on our mean faces.
342
00:28:42 --> 00:28:44
 Groot, put that thing away, now. I don't wanna tell you again.
343
00:28:45 --> 00:28:45
 Groot.
344
00:28:46 --> 00:28:47
 I am Groot!
345
00:28:47 --> 00:28:48
 - Whoa! - Language!
346
00:28:48 --> 00:28:49
 - Hey! - Wow.
347
00:28:49 --> 00:28:51
 You got some acorns on you, kid.
348
00:28:51 --> 00:28:54
 Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole.
349
00:28:55 --> 00:28:58
 Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces.
350
00:29:05 --> 00:29:07
 What happened?
351
00:29:11 --> 00:29:12
 Oh, my God.
352
00:29:18 --> 00:29:19
 Looks like we're not getting paid.
353
00:29:22 --> 00:29:24
 Wipers! Wipers!
354
00:29:24 --> 00:29:25
 Get it off.
355
00:29:32 --> 00:29:34
 How the hell is this dude still alive?
356
00:29:35 --> 00:29:36
 He is not a dude.
357
00:29:37 --> 00:29:38
 You're a dude.
358
00:29:40 --> 00:29:41
 This is a man.
359
00:29:42 --> 00:29:45
 A handsome, muscular man.
360
00:29:45 --> 00:29:46
 I'm muscular.
361
00:29:46 --> 00:29:48
 But who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.
362
00:29:49 --> 00:29:49
 Yeah, right.
363
00:29:50 --> 00:29:52
 - It's true, Quill. You have put on weight. - What?
364
00:29:54 --> 00:29:56
 Gamora, do you think I'm...
365
00:29:59 --> 00:30:02
 He is anxious, angry.
366
00:30:02 --> 00:30:05
 He feels tremendous loss and guilt.
367
00:30:06 --> 00:30:09
 It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.
368
00:30:09 --> 00:30:10
 Wow.
369
00:30:10 --> 00:30:12
 This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay.
370
00:30:12 --> 00:30:16
 I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
371
00:30:16 --> 00:30:17
 You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?
372
00:30:18 --> 00:30:21
 It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.
373
00:30:21 --> 00:30:23
 Stop massaging his muscles.
374
00:30:25 --> 00:30:25
 Wake him up.
375
00:30:29 --> 00:30:30
 Wake.
376
00:30:47 --> 00:30:49
 Who the hell are you guys?
377
00:30:52 --> 00:30:56
 The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal.
378
00:30:56 --> 00:31:00
 To bring balance to the universe by wiping out half of all life.
379
00:31:01 --> 00:31:05
 He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre.
380
00:31:05 --> 00:31:06
 Including my own.
381
00:31:06 --> 00:31:08
 If he gets all six Infinity Stones...
382
00:31:08 --> 00:31:10
 he can do it with the snap of his fingers like this.
383
00:31:11 --> 00:31:14
 You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.
384
00:31:14 --> 00:31:18
 Gamora is the daughter of Thanos.
385
00:31:22 --> 00:31:24
 Your father killed my brother.
386
00:31:24 --> 00:31:26
 Oh, boy.
387
00:31:26 --> 00:31:27
 Stepfather, technically.
388
00:31:28 --> 00:31:29
 And she hates him as much as you do.
389
00:31:33 --> 00:31:35
 Families can be tough.
390
00:31:35 --> 00:31:38
 Before my father died, he told me that I had a half-sister...
391
00:31:38 --> 00:31:40
 that he imprisoned in Hel.
392
00:31:41 --> 00:31:44
 And then she returned home and stabbed me in the eye.
393
00:31:44 --> 00:31:45
 So I had to kill her.
394
00:31:45 --> 00:31:49
 That's life though, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and...
395
00:31:49 --> 00:31:50
 I feel your pain.
396
00:31:51 --> 00:31:53
 I feel your pain as well, because...
397
00:31:53 --> 00:31:55
 I mean, it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot.
398
00:31:56 --> 00:31:57
 My father killed my mother.
399
00:31:57 --> 00:32:00
 And then I had to kill my father. That was hard.
400
00:32:00 --> 00:32:03
 Probably even harder than having to kill a sister.
401
00:32:04 --> 00:32:07
 Plus, I came out with both my eyes, which was...
402
00:32:07 --> 00:32:09
 I need a hammer, not a spoon.
403
00:32:10 --> 00:32:13
 How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of...
404
00:32:14 --> 00:32:17
 A four-digit code, maybe? Maybe a birthdate.
405
00:32:18 --> 00:32:20
 - What are you doing? - Taking your pod.
406
00:32:21 --> 00:32:22
 No, you're not.
407
00:32:25 --> 00:32:28
 You will not be taking our pod today, sir.
408
00:32:30 --> 00:32:32
 Quill, are you making your voice deeper?
409
00:32:34 --> 00:32:36
 - No. - You are.
410
00:32:36 --> 00:32:39
 You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.
411
00:32:39 --> 00:32:40
 No, I'm not.
412
00:32:40 --> 00:32:42
 - He just did it again! - This is my voice.
413
00:32:49 --> 00:32:50
 Are you mocking me?
414
00:32:50 --> 00:32:53
 - Are you mocking me? - Stop it. You did it again.
415
00:32:54 --> 00:32:55
 - He's trying to copy me. - I need you to stop doing that.
416
00:32:56 --> 00:32:57
 - Enough! - He's doing it first.
417
00:32:57 --> 00:32:59
 We need to stop Thanos.
418
00:32:59 --> 00:33:02
 Which means we need to find out where he's going next.
419
00:33:02 --> 00:33:03
 Knowhere.
420
00:33:03 --> 00:33:05
 He must be going somewhere.
421
00:33:05 --> 00:33:07
 No, no. Knowhere?
422
00:33:07 --> 00:33:10
 It's a place. We've been there. It sucks.
423
00:33:10 --> 00:33:12
 - Excuse me, that's our food. - Not anymore.
424
00:33:13 --> 00:33:16
 Thor, why would he go to Knowhere?
425
00:33:16 --> 00:33:17
 Because for years...
426
00:33:18 --> 00:33:21
 the Reality Stone's been safely stored there with a man called the Collector.
427
00:33:21 --> 00:33:23
 If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe.
428
00:33:23 --> 00:33:25
 Only an idiot would give that man a stone.
429
00:33:25 --> 00:33:26
 - Or a genius. - How do you know...
430
00:33:27 --> 00:33:29
 he's not going for one of the other stones?
431
00:33:29 --> 00:33:32
 There are six stones out there.
432
00:33:32 --> 00:33:34
 Thanos already has the Power Stone...
433
00:33:34 --> 00:33:37
 because he stole it last week when he decimated Xandar.
434
00:33:38 --> 00:33:40
 He stole the Space Stone from me...
435
00:33:40 --> 00:33:43
 when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people.
436
00:33:43 --> 00:33:46
 The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.
437
00:33:46 --> 00:33:48
 - The Avengers? - Earth's mightiest heroes.
438
00:33:48 --> 00:33:50
 Like Kevin Bacon?
439
00:33:50 --> 00:33:52
 He may be on the team. I don't know. I haven't been there in a while.
440
00:33:52 --> 00:33:54
 As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that.
441
00:33:55 --> 00:33:56
 No one even knows where it is.
442
00:33:56 --> 00:34:00
 Therefore Thanos can't get it. Therefore he's going to Knowhere.
443
00:34:00 --> 00:34:02
 Hence he'll be getting the Reality Stone.
444
00:34:03 --> 00:34:04
 You're welcome.
445
00:34:04 --> 00:34:05
 Then we have to go to Knowhere now.
446
00:34:05 --> 00:34:09
 Wrong. Where we have to go is Nidavellir.
447
00:34:09 --> 00:34:11
 - That's a made-up word. - All words are made up.
448
00:34:11 --> 00:34:14
 Nidavellir is real? Seriously?
449
00:34:14 --> 00:34:16
 That place is a legend.
450
00:34:16 --> 00:34:20
 They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the universe.
451
00:34:20 --> 00:34:22
 I would very much like to go there, please.
452
00:34:22 --> 00:34:24
 The rabbit is correct and clearly the smartest among you.
453
00:34:24 --> 00:34:25
 Rabbit?
454
00:34:26 --> 00:34:28
 Only Eitri the Dwarf can make me the weapon I need.
455
00:34:28 --> 00:34:29
 I assume you're the captain, sir.
456
00:34:29 --> 00:34:30
 You're very perceptive.
457
00:34:31 --> 00:34:33
 You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?
458
00:34:34 --> 00:34:36
 Let me just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me!
459
00:34:37 --> 00:34:38
 - Yeah. I'll go. - Wonderful!
460
00:34:39 --> 00:34:41
 - Except for that I'm the captain. - Quiet.
461
00:34:41 --> 00:34:42
 - That's my backpack. - Go sit down.
462
00:34:43 --> 00:34:44
 Look, this is my ship.
463
00:34:44 --> 00:34:46
 And I'm not goin' to...
464
00:34:47 --> 00:34:49
 Wait, what kinda weapon are we talkin' about here?
465
00:34:49 --> 00:34:51
 The Thanos-killing kind.
466
00:34:51 --> 00:34:53
 Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?
467
00:34:53 --> 00:34:55
 No. You simply lack the strength to wield them.
468
00:34:55 --> 00:34:58
 Your bodies would crumble as your minds collapsed into madness.
469
00:34:58 --> 00:35:00
 Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?
470
00:35:00 --> 00:35:01
 A little bit, yeah.
471
00:35:01 --> 00:35:04
 If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone...
472
00:35:04 --> 00:35:06
 he'll be too powerful to stop.
473
00:35:06 --> 00:35:08
 - He already is. - I got it figured out.
474
00:35:08 --> 00:35:12
 We got two ships and a large assortment of morons.
475
00:35:12 --> 00:35:15
 So me and Groot will go with the pirate angel here.
476
00:35:15 --> 00:35:18
 And the morons will go to Knowhere to try to stop Thanos.
477
00:35:18 --> 00:35:20
 - Cool? Cool. - So cool.
478
00:35:20 --> 00:35:22
 For the record...
479
00:35:22 --> 00:35:25
 I know that you're going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.
480
00:35:25 --> 00:35:29
 You know, you really shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill.
481
00:35:30 --> 00:35:31
 Come on, Groot.
482
00:35:31 --> 00:35:34
 Put that game down. You'll rot your brain.
483
00:35:38 --> 00:35:41
 I bid you farewell and good luck, morons.
484
00:35:41 --> 00:35:42
 Bye.
485
00:35:57 --> 00:35:58
 Vis?
486
00:35:58 --> 00:36:00
 Is it the stone again?
487
00:36:01 --> 00:36:02
 It's as if it's speaking to me.
488
00:36:03 --> 00:36:05
 What does it say?
489
00:36:05 --> 00:36:08
 I don't know, but something.
490
00:36:10 --> 00:36:11
 Hey.
491
00:36:21 --> 00:36:24
 Tell me what you feel.
492
00:36:31 --> 00:36:33
 I just feel you.
493
00:36:42 --> 00:36:43
 So there's a 10:00 a.m. to Glasgow...
494
00:36:44 --> 00:36:46
 which would give us more time together before you went back.
495
00:36:46 --> 00:36:47
 What if I miss that train?
496
00:36:47 --> 00:36:48
 There's an 11:00.
497
00:36:49 --> 00:36:51
 What if I missed all the trains?
498
00:36:52 --> 00:36:54
 What if this time I didn't go back?
499
00:36:54 --> 00:36:56
 But you gave Stark your word.
500
00:36:56 --> 00:36:57
 I'd rather give it to you.
501
00:36:57 --> 00:36:59
 Well, there are people who are expecting me too, you know.
502
00:36:59 --> 00:37:00
 We both made promises.
503
00:37:01 --> 00:37:02
 Not to each other.
504
00:37:03 --> 00:37:04
 Wanda.
505
00:37:05 --> 00:37:07
 For two years, we've stolen these moments...
506
00:37:07 --> 00:37:09
 trying to see if this could work and...
507
00:37:09 --> 00:37:11
 I don't know.
508
00:37:11 --> 00:37:13
 You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself.
509
00:37:14 --> 00:37:15
 I think...
510
00:37:15 --> 00:37:16
 - It works. - It works.
511
00:37:16 --> 00:37:18
 It works.
512
00:37:20 --> 00:37:21
 Stay.
513
00:37:22 --> 00:37:24
 Stay with me.
514
00:37:29 --> 00:37:32
 Or not. If I'm overstepping...
515
00:37:39 --> 00:37:41
 What are they?
516
00:37:41 --> 00:37:44
 What the stone was warning me about.
517
00:37:54 --> 00:37:55
 I have to go.
518
00:37:55 --> 00:37:56
 No, Vision.
519
00:37:57 --> 00:38:01
 Vision, if that's true, then maybe going isn't the best idea.
520
00:38:02 --> 00:38:03
 Wanda, I...
521
00:38:03 --> 00:38:04
 Vision!
522
00:38:33 --> 00:38:36
 The blade, it stopped me from phasing.
523
00:38:37 --> 00:38:39
 - Is that even possible? - It isn't supposed to be.
524
00:38:40 --> 00:38:42
 My systems are failing.
525
00:38:42 --> 00:38:45
 I'm beginning to think we should have stayed in bed.
526
00:38:48 --> 00:38:48
 Vis!
527
00:38:58 --> 00:39:01
 Give up the stone, and she lives.
528
00:39:39 --> 00:39:41
 Hands off.
529
00:39:56 --> 00:39:58
 Come on. Come on.
530
00:39:58 --> 00:40:00
 Come on, you gotta get up.
531
00:40:00 --> 00:40:02
 You gotta get up. Come on. Hey.
532
00:40:03 --> 00:40:04
 Hey. We have to go.
533
00:40:06 --> 00:40:09
 Please. Please leave.
534
00:40:09 --> 00:40:11
 You asked me to stay.
535
00:40:12 --> 00:40:13
 - I'm staying. - Please.
536
00:41:24 --> 00:41:26
 - Get up. - I can't.
537
00:41:26 --> 00:41:29
 We don't wanna kill you, but we will.
538
00:41:29 --> 00:41:31
 You'll never get the chance again.
539
00:41:47 --> 00:41:49
 Can you stand?
540
00:41:54 --> 00:41:55
 Thank you, Captain.
541
00:41:58 --> 00:41:59
 Let's get you on the jet.
542
00:42:03 --> 00:42:07
 Now, I thought we had a deal.
543
00:42:07 --> 00:42:11
 Stay close, check in, don't take any chances.
544
00:42:11 --> 00:42:12
 I'm sorry.
545
00:42:12 --> 00:42:14
 We just wanted time.
546
00:42:17 --> 00:42:18
 Where to, Cap?
547
00:42:21 --> 00:42:22
 Home.
548
00:42:26 --> 00:42:28
 We'll be safe. We'll be safe.
549
00:42:53 --> 00:42:54
 Zehobereians.
550
00:42:54 --> 00:42:56
 Mother! Where's my mother?
551
00:42:56 --> 00:42:57
 Choose a side or die.
552
00:42:57 --> 00:42:59
 Mother!
553
00:42:59 --> 00:43:01
 One side is a revelation...
554
00:43:01 --> 00:43:04
 the other an honor known only to a few.
555
00:43:05 --> 00:43:07
 What's wrong, little one?
556
00:43:07 --> 00:43:11
 My mother. Where is my mother?
557
00:43:15 --> 00:43:17
 What's your name?
558
00:43:18 --> 00:43:20
 Gamora.
559
00:43:20 --> 00:43:22
 You're quite the fighter, Gamora.
560
00:43:24 --> 00:43:25
 Come.
561
00:43:25 --> 00:43:26
 Let me help you.
562
00:43:40 --> 00:43:41
 Look.
563
00:43:45 --> 00:43:46
 Pretty, isn't it?
564
00:43:47 --> 00:43:50
 Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
565
00:43:51 --> 00:43:54
 Too much to one side or the other...
566
00:43:58 --> 00:44:01
 Here. You try.
567
00:44:05 --> 00:44:08
 Now, go in peace to meet your maker.
568
00:44:13 --> 00:44:15
 Concentrate.
569
00:44:18 --> 00:44:21
 There. You've got it.
570
00:44:30 --> 00:44:31
 Gamora.
571
00:44:32 --> 00:44:36
 Do you know if these grenades are the blow-off-your-junk kind or the gas kind?
572
00:44:36 --> 00:44:39
 Because I was thinking about hanging a couple on my belt right here.
573
00:44:39 --> 00:44:41
 - But I don't want to if they're the... - I need to ask a favor.
574
00:44:42 --> 00:44:43
 Yeah, sure.
575
00:44:45 --> 00:44:48
 One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.
576
00:44:50 --> 00:44:51
 Which is what the grenades are for.
577
00:44:53 --> 00:44:55
 I'm sorry. What's the favor?
578
00:44:57 --> 00:44:58
 If things go wrong...
579
00:45:00 --> 00:45:02
 If Thanos gets me...
580
00:45:06 --> 00:45:08
 I want you to promise me...
581
00:45:09 --> 00:45:11
 you'll kill me.
582
00:45:11 --> 00:45:12
 What?
583
00:45:15 --> 00:45:18
 I know something he doesn't.
584
00:45:20 --> 00:45:24
 And if he finds it out, the entire universe could be at risk.
585
00:45:25 --> 00:45:26
 What do you know?
586
00:45:26 --> 00:45:28
 If I tell you, you'd know too.
587
00:45:31 --> 00:45:33
 If it's so important...
588
00:45:33 --> 00:45:34
 shouldn't I?
589
00:45:34 --> 00:45:35
 Only if you wanna die.
590
00:45:36 --> 00:45:37
 Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?
591
00:45:39 --> 00:45:40
 Just...
592
00:45:42 --> 00:45:45
 Trust me. And possibly kill me.
593
00:45:45 --> 00:45:47
 I mean, I'd like to.
594
00:45:48 --> 00:45:49
 I really would. But you...
595
00:45:50 --> 00:45:51
 Swear to me.
596
00:45:54 --> 00:45:57
 Swear to me on your mother.
597
00:46:04 --> 00:46:05
 Okay.
598
00:46:11 --> 00:46:12
 Okay.
599
00:46:29 --> 00:46:31
 Dude. How long have you been standing there?
600
00:46:31 --> 00:46:32
 An hour.
601
00:46:32 --> 00:46:34
 An hour?
602
00:46:34 --> 00:46:35
 Are you serious?
603
00:46:36 --> 00:46:41
 I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still...
604
00:46:42 --> 00:46:44
 that I become invisible to the eye.
605
00:46:45 --> 00:46:46
 Watch.
606
00:46:50 --> 00:46:51
 You're eating a zarg-nut.
607
00:46:52 --> 00:46:53
 But my movement...
608
00:46:54 --> 00:46:56
 was so slow...
609
00:46:57 --> 00:46:58
 that it's imperceptible.
610
00:46:59 --> 00:47:00
 No.
611
00:47:01 --> 00:47:02
 I'm sure I'm invisible.
612
00:47:02 --> 00:47:03
 Hi, Drax.
613
00:47:06 --> 00:47:07
 Damn it.
614
00:47:27 --> 00:47:29
 This place looks deserted.
615
00:47:29 --> 00:47:32
 I'm reading movement in the third quadrant.
616
00:47:32 --> 00:47:34
 Yep, I'm picking that up too.
617
00:47:35 --> 00:47:37
 Let's put down right here.
618
00:47:48 --> 00:47:50
 I don't have it.
619
00:47:52 --> 00:47:55
 Everyone in the galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother...
620
00:47:56 --> 00:47:59
 if you thought it would add even the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.
621
00:48:07 --> 00:48:09
 I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan.
622
00:48:10 --> 00:48:14
 Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.
623
00:48:17 --> 00:48:19
 I told you.
624
00:48:20 --> 00:48:21
 I sold it.
625
00:48:23 --> 00:48:25
 Why would I lie?
626
00:48:26 --> 00:48:28
 I imagine it's like breathing for you.
627
00:48:29 --> 00:48:30
 Like suicide.
628
00:48:30 --> 00:48:32
 You do understand.
629
00:48:33 --> 00:48:36
 Not even you would surrender something so precious.
630
00:48:36 --> 00:48:38
 I didn't know what it was.
631
00:48:38 --> 00:48:40
 Then you're more of a fool than I took you for.
632
00:48:41 --> 00:48:42
 It's him.
633
00:48:42 --> 00:48:43
 Last chance, charlatan.
634
00:48:45 --> 00:48:47
 Where's the stone?
635
00:48:47 --> 00:48:48
 Today...
636
00:48:49 --> 00:48:50
 Drax. Drax.
637
00:48:50 --> 00:48:52
 ...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.
638
00:48:52 --> 00:48:53
 Drax, wait.
639
00:48:54 --> 00:48:56
 Not yet, not yet, not yet.
640
00:48:56 --> 00:48:57
 Drax.
641
00:49:01 --> 00:49:03
 Drax, Drax, Drax. Listen to me.
642
00:49:03 --> 00:49:06
 He doesn't have the stone yet.
643
00:49:06 --> 00:49:07
 If we get it, then we can stop him.
644
00:49:08 --> 00:49:11
 We have to get the stone first. Yeah.
645
00:49:12 --> 00:49:13
 No.
646
00:49:13 --> 00:49:16
 No. For Ovette, for Camaria.
647
00:49:16 --> 00:49:18
 Sleep.
648
00:49:30 --> 00:49:31
 Okay.
649
00:49:31 --> 00:49:35
 Gamora, Mantis, you go right.
650
00:49:36 --> 00:49:37
 The other right.
651
00:50:02 --> 00:50:04
 Why?
652
00:50:14 --> 00:50:18
 Why you, daughter?
653
00:50:36 --> 00:50:37
 That was quick.
654
00:50:43 --> 00:50:48
 Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!
655
00:50:50 --> 00:50:53
 Is that sadness I sense in you, daughter?
656
00:50:56 --> 00:50:59
 In my heart, I knew you still cared.
657
00:51:06 --> 00:51:09
 But one never knows for sure.
658
00:51:18 --> 00:51:21
 Reality is often disappointing.
659
00:51:24 --> 00:51:27
 That is, it was.
660
00:51:29 --> 00:51:30
 Now...
661
00:51:32 --> 00:51:35
 reality can be whatever I want.
662
00:51:36 --> 00:51:38
 You knew I'd come.
663
00:51:38 --> 00:51:40
 I counted on it.
664
00:51:40 --> 00:51:43
 There's something we need to discuss, little one.
665
00:51:48 --> 00:51:50
 Thanos!
666
00:51:57 --> 00:51:58
 No!
667
00:52:03 --> 00:52:04
 Let her go, Grimace.
668
00:52:05 --> 00:52:06
 Peter.
669
00:52:07 --> 00:52:09
 I told you to go right.
670
00:52:09 --> 00:52:10
 Now? Really?
671
00:52:11 --> 00:52:12
 You let her go!
672
00:52:13 --> 00:52:14
 The boyfriend.
673
00:52:14 --> 00:52:15
 No.
674
00:52:16 --> 00:52:19
 Like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing, long-term booty call.
675
00:52:19 --> 00:52:21
 - Let her go. - Peter.
676
00:52:22 --> 00:52:26
 I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face.
677
00:52:27 --> 00:52:28
 Not him.
678
00:52:39 --> 00:52:43
 You promised. You promised.
679
00:52:47 --> 00:52:48
 Oh, daughter.
680
00:52:48 --> 00:52:51
 You expect too much from him.
681
00:52:55 --> 00:52:56
 She's asked, hasn't she?
682
00:53:00 --> 00:53:01
 Do it.
683
00:53:07 --> 00:53:09
 Do it!
684
00:53:16 --> 00:53:17
 I told you to go right.
685
00:53:19 --> 00:53:22
 I love you more than anything.
686
00:53:25 --> 00:53:27
 I love you too.
687
00:53:41 --> 00:53:42
 I like him.
688
00:54:13 --> 00:54:15
 Still no word from Vision?
689
00:54:15 --> 00:54:17
 Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.
690
00:54:18 --> 00:54:21
 On a stolen Quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.
691
00:54:21 --> 00:54:23
 You know they're only criminals because
692
00:54:23 --> 00:54:24
 you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?
693
00:54:25 --> 00:54:26
 My God, Rhodes.
694
00:54:26 --> 00:54:29
 Your talent for horseshit rivals my own.
695
00:54:29 --> 00:54:32
 If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.
696
00:54:33 --> 00:54:36
 I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.
697
00:54:36 --> 00:54:37
 That's right.
698
00:54:39 --> 00:54:41
 And I'm pretty sure I paid for that.
699
00:54:41 --> 00:54:43
 You have second thoughts?
700
00:54:43 --> 00:54:44
 Not anymore.
701
00:54:50 --> 00:54:52
 Mr. Secretary.
702
00:54:56 --> 00:54:58
 You got some nerve.
703
00:54:59 --> 00:55:00
 I'll give you that.
704
00:55:01 --> 00:55:02
 You could use some of that right now.
705
00:55:03 --> 00:55:05
 The world's on fire.
706
00:55:06 --> 00:55:09
 And you think all is forgiven?
707
00:55:10 --> 00:55:14
 I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking permission.
708
00:55:16 --> 00:55:18
 Earth just lost her best defender.
709
00:55:18 --> 00:55:20
 So we're here to fight.
710
00:55:21 --> 00:55:23
 And if you wanna stand in our way...
711
00:55:24 --> 00:55:26
 we'll fight you too.
712
00:55:29 --> 00:55:30
 Arrest them.
713
00:55:31 --> 00:55:33
 All over it.
714
00:55:38 --> 00:55:40
 That's a court-martial.
715
00:55:42 --> 00:55:43
 It's great to see you, Cap.
716
00:55:44 --> 00:55:45
 You too, Rhodey.
717
00:55:46 --> 00:55:47
 Hey.
718
00:55:49 --> 00:55:51
 Wow. You guys...
719
00:55:51 --> 00:55:53
 really look like crap.
720
00:55:54 --> 00:55:55
 Must've been a rough couple years.
721
00:55:55 --> 00:55:58
 Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.
722
00:55:58 --> 00:56:01
 I think you look great.
723
00:56:08 --> 00:56:10
 Yeah, I'm back.
724
00:56:11 --> 00:56:12
 Hi, Bruce.
725
00:56:18 --> 00:56:19
 Nat.
726
00:56:22 --> 00:56:24
 This is awkward.
727
00:56:26 --> 00:56:28
 So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?
728
00:56:28 --> 00:56:29
 And they can clearly find us.
729
00:56:29 --> 00:56:32
 We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?
730
00:56:32 --> 00:56:35
 After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal.
731
00:56:35 --> 00:56:37
 It was too tough on their families. They're on house arrest.
732
00:56:37 --> 00:56:38
 - Who's Scott? - Ant-Man.
733
00:56:38 --> 00:56:40
 There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?
734
00:56:41 --> 00:56:42
 Okay, look.
735
00:56:42 --> 00:56:45
 Thanos has the biggest army in the universe...
736
00:56:45 --> 00:56:48
 and he is not gonna stop until he gets...
737
00:56:50 --> 00:56:51
 Vision's stone.
738
00:56:51 --> 00:56:53
 Then we have to protect it.
739
00:56:53 --> 00:56:54
 No, we have to destroy it.
740
00:56:57 --> 00:56:59
 I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head.
741
00:56:59 --> 00:57:01
 About its nature.
742
00:57:01 --> 00:57:03
 But also its composition.
743
00:57:03 --> 00:57:07
 I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source...
744
00:57:08 --> 00:57:11
 something very similar to its own signature, perhaps...
745
00:57:13 --> 00:57:15
 its molecular integrity could fail.
746
00:57:16 --> 00:57:18
 Yeah, and you with it.
747
00:57:18 --> 00:57:20
 We're not having this conversation.
748
00:57:20 --> 00:57:24
 Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.
749
00:57:25 --> 00:57:27
 That's too high a price.
750
00:57:31 --> 00:57:34
 Only you have the power to pay it.
751
00:57:38 --> 00:57:40
 Thanos threatens half the universe.
752
00:57:40 --> 00:57:43
 One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.
753
00:57:43 --> 00:57:44
 But it should.
754
00:57:47 --> 00:57:48
 We don't trade lives, Vision.
755
00:57:48 --> 00:57:50
 Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life...
756
00:57:51 --> 00:57:52
 to save how many millions of people?
757
00:57:52 --> 00:57:55
 Tell me, why is this any different?
758
00:57:55 --> 00:57:57
 Because you might have a choice.
759
00:57:58 --> 00:58:02
 Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays.
760
00:58:02 --> 00:58:06
 Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.
761
00:58:06 --> 00:58:09
 All of them mixed together, all of them learning from one another.
762
00:58:10 --> 00:58:11
 You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?
763
00:58:12 --> 00:58:15
 I'm saying that if we take out the stone...
764
00:58:15 --> 00:58:18
 there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.
765
00:58:18 --> 00:58:20
 Can we do that?
766
00:58:20 --> 00:58:21
 Not me, not here.
767
00:58:22 --> 00:58:25
 Well, you better find someone and somewhere fast.
768
00:58:25 --> 00:58:28
 Ross isn't just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.
769
00:58:31 --> 00:58:33
 I know somewhere.
770
00:58:47 --> 00:58:50
 The Kingsguard and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.
771
00:58:50 --> 00:58:51
 And the Border Tribe?
772
00:58:52 --> 00:58:54
 Those that are left.
773
00:58:54 --> 00:58:56
 Send word to the Jabari as well.
774
00:58:56 --> 00:58:58
 M'Baku likes a good fight.
775
00:59:01 --> 00:59:02
 And what of this one?
776
00:59:03 --> 00:59:05
 This one may be tired of war.
777
00:59:05 --> 00:59:08
 But the White Wolf has rested long enough.
778
00:59:31 --> 00:59:33
 Where's the fight?
779
00:59:33 --> 00:59:35
 On its way.
780
00:59:53 --> 00:59:56
 In all the time I've served Thanos...
781
00:59:58 --> 01:00:00
 I have never failed him.
782
01:00:05 --> 01:00:08
 If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan...
783
01:00:08 --> 01:00:12
 with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person...
784
01:00:12 --> 01:00:15
 there would be judgment.
785
01:00:23 --> 01:00:25
 Give me...
786
01:00:29 --> 01:00:30
 the stone.
787
01:00:42 --> 01:00:45
 Wow, you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?
788
01:00:45 --> 01:00:47
 Yeah, speaking of loyalty...
789
01:00:47 --> 01:00:48
 What the...
790
01:00:49 --> 01:00:50
 - I know what you're gonna say. - You should not be here.
791
01:00:51 --> 01:00:52
 - I was gonna go home. - I don't wanna hear it.
792
01:00:52 --> 01:00:53
 But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...
793
01:00:53 --> 01:00:55
 - And now I gotta hear it. - ...and kinda stuck to the side of the ship.
794
01:00:55 --> 01:00:57
 And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way.
795
01:00:58 --> 01:00:59
 God damn it.
796
01:00:59 --> 01:01:01
 So, if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.
797
01:01:02 --> 01:01:03
 - What did you just say? - I take that back.
798
01:01:03 --> 01:01:07
 - And now, I'm here in space. - Yeah, right where I didn't want you to be.
799
01:01:07 --> 01:01:09
 This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip.
800
01:01:09 --> 01:01:12
 This is a one-way ticket. You hear me?
801
01:01:12 --> 01:01:13
 - Don't pretend you thought this through. - No, I did think this through.
802
01:01:14 --> 01:01:15
 You could not have possibly thought this through.
803
01:01:15 --> 01:01:19
 You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.
804
01:01:21 --> 01:01:23
 Okay, that didn't really make sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.
805
01:01:26 --> 01:01:28
 Come on. We got a situation.
806
01:01:29 --> 01:01:31
 See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan?
807
01:01:31 --> 01:01:33
 Go.
808
01:01:33 --> 01:01:34
 Okay, okay...
809
01:01:35 --> 01:01:38
 Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?
810
01:01:42 --> 01:01:44
 Painful, aren't they?
811
01:01:45 --> 01:01:48
 They were originally designed for microsurgery.
812
01:01:48 --> 01:01:51
 And any one of them...
813
01:01:56 --> 01:01:58
 could end your friend's life in an instant.
814
01:01:58 --> 01:02:00
 I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend.
815
01:02:00 --> 01:02:03
 Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy.
816
01:02:05 --> 01:02:06
 You've saved nothing.
817
01:02:07 --> 01:02:11
 Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.
818
01:02:11 --> 01:02:13
 Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.
819
01:02:27 --> 01:02:29
 Yes! Wait. What are those?
820
01:02:45 --> 01:02:46
 Hey, we haven't officially met.
821
01:02:48 --> 01:02:49
 Cool.
822
01:02:51 --> 01:02:52
 We gotta turn this ship around.
823
01:02:52 --> 01:02:54
 Yeah, now he wants to run. Great plan.
824
01:02:54 --> 01:02:56
 No, I want to protect the stone.
825
01:02:56 --> 01:02:59
 And I want you to thank me. Now, go ahead. I'm listening.
826
01:02:59 --> 01:03:02
 For what? Nearly blasting me into space?
827
01:03:02 --> 01:03:04
 Who just saved your magical ass? Me.
828
01:03:04 --> 01:03:07
 I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.
829
01:03:07 --> 01:03:09
 Admit it, you should've ducked out when I told you to.
830
01:03:09 --> 01:03:11
 I tried to bench you. You refused.
831
01:03:11 --> 01:03:13
 Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.
832
01:03:13 --> 01:03:16
 And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut...
833
01:03:16 --> 01:03:18
 billions of miles from Earth with no backup.
834
01:03:18 --> 01:03:20
 - I'm backup. - No, you're a stowaway.
835
01:03:20 --> 01:03:21
 The adults are talking.
836
01:03:21 --> 01:03:24
 I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here.
837
01:03:24 --> 01:03:26
 What is he, your ward?
838
01:03:26 --> 01:03:27
 No.
839
01:03:27 --> 01:03:29
 - I'm Peter, by the way. - Doctor Strange.
840
01:03:29 --> 01:03:30
 Oh, you're using our made-up names.
841
01:03:32 --> 01:03:33
 I'm Spider-Man, then.
842
01:03:34 --> 01:03:37
 This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.
843
01:03:37 --> 01:03:39
 Can we control it?
844
01:03:39 --> 01:03:41
 Fly us home?
845
01:03:44 --> 01:03:45
 - Stark? - Yeah.
846
01:03:45 --> 01:03:46
 Can you get us home?
847
01:03:46 --> 01:03:47
 Yeah, I heard you.
848
01:03:49 --> 01:03:51
 I'm thinking I'm not so sure we should.
849
01:03:52 --> 01:03:56
 Under no circumstances can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos.
850
01:03:56 --> 01:03:58
 I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.
851
01:03:59 --> 01:04:01
 What? No. It's you who doesn't understand...
852
01:04:01 --> 01:04:04
 that Thanos has been inside my head for six years.
853
01:04:04 --> 01:04:07
 Since he sent an army to New York and now he's back.
854
01:04:07 --> 01:04:09
 And I don't know what to do.
855
01:04:09 --> 01:04:13
 So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his...
856
01:04:13 --> 01:04:16
 but you saw what they did, what they can do.
857
01:04:16 --> 01:04:19
 At least on his turf, he's not expecting it.
858
01:04:19 --> 01:04:22
 So I say we take the fight to him.
859
01:04:22 --> 01:04:23
 Doctor.
860
01:04:24 --> 01:04:26
 Do you concur?
861
01:04:29 --> 01:04:31
 All right, Stark. We go to him.
862
01:04:32 --> 01:04:34
 But you have to understand...
863
01:04:35 --> 01:04:39
 if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone...
864
01:04:39 --> 01:04:42
 I will not hesitate to let either of you die.
865
01:04:43 --> 01:04:46
 I can't, because the universe depends on it.
866
01:04:47 --> 01:04:50
 Nice. Good, moral compass.
867
01:04:51 --> 01:04:52
 We're straight.
868
01:04:54 --> 01:04:55
 All right, kid.
869
01:04:56 --> 01:04:57
 You're an Avenger now.
870
01:05:34 --> 01:05:36
 I thought you might be hungry.
871
01:05:48 --> 01:05:50
 I always hated that chair.
872
01:05:50 --> 01:05:52
 So I've been told.
873
01:05:53 --> 01:05:57
 Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day.
874
01:05:58 --> 01:05:59
 I hated this room.
875
01:06:00 --> 01:06:01
 This ship.
876
01:06:01 --> 01:06:03
 I hated my life.
877
01:06:08 --> 01:06:10
 You told me that too.
878
01:06:13 --> 01:06:14
 Every day.
879
01:06:17 --> 01:06:19
 For almost 20 years.
880
01:06:22 --> 01:06:24
 I was a child when you took me.
881
01:06:25 --> 01:06:26
 I saved you.
882
01:06:30 --> 01:06:31
 No.
883
01:06:32 --> 01:06:36
 No. We were happy on my home planet.
884
01:06:36 --> 01:06:39
 Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps.
885
01:06:40 --> 01:06:45
 Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that.
886
01:06:45 --> 01:06:47
 Do you know what's happened since then?
887
01:06:47 --> 01:06:49
 The children born...
888
01:06:49 --> 01:06:53
 have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies.
889
01:06:53 --> 01:06:54
 It's a paradise.
890
01:06:57 --> 01:06:59
 Because you murdered half the planet.
891
01:06:59 --> 01:07:02
 A small price to pay for salvation.
892
01:07:02 --> 01:07:03
 You're insane.
893
01:07:03 --> 01:07:05
 Little one, it's a simple calculus.
894
01:07:05 --> 01:07:08
 This universe is finite, its resources finite.
895
01:07:09 --> 01:07:13
 If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist.
896
01:07:13 --> 01:07:14
 It needs correction.
897
01:07:14 --> 01:07:16
 You don't know that!
898
01:07:17 --> 01:07:19
 I'm the only one who knows that.
899
01:07:20 --> 01:07:24
 At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.
900
01:07:26 --> 01:07:27
 For a time...
901
01:07:29 --> 01:07:34
 you had that same will...
902
01:07:35 --> 01:07:38
 as you fought by my side.
903
01:07:38 --> 01:07:40
 Daughter.
904
01:07:40 --> 01:07:42
 I'm not your daughter.
905
01:07:45 --> 01:07:47
 Everything I hate about myself you taught me.
906
01:07:48 --> 01:07:52
 And, in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy.
907
01:07:55 --> 01:07:58
 That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.
908
01:08:01 --> 01:08:03
 I'm sorry I disappointed you.
909
01:08:05 --> 01:08:07
 I am disappointed.
910
01:08:08 --> 01:08:10
 But not because you didn't find it.
911
01:08:14 --> 01:08:15
 But because you did.
912
01:08:17 --> 01:08:19
 And you lied.
913
01:08:36 --> 01:08:37
 Nebula.
914
01:08:44 --> 01:08:45
 Don't do this.
915
01:08:46 --> 01:08:50
 Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.
916
01:08:50 --> 01:08:51
 Please don't do this.
917
01:08:51 --> 01:08:53
 And very nearly succeeded.
918
01:08:54 --> 01:08:55
 So I brought her here.
919
01:08:57 --> 01:08:58
 To talk.
920
01:09:06 --> 01:09:08
 Stop. Stop it.
921
01:09:14 --> 01:09:16
 I swear to you on my life.
922
01:09:17 --> 01:09:19
 I never found the Soul Stone.
923
01:09:23 --> 01:09:25
 Accessing memory files.
924
01:09:25 --> 01:09:26
 You know what he's about to do.
925
01:09:26 --> 01:09:29
 He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones.
926
01:09:29 --> 01:09:30
 - All of them. - He can never get them all.
927
01:09:31 --> 01:09:34
 - He will! - He can't, Nebula.
928
01:09:34 --> 01:09:36
 Because I found the map to the Soul Stone...
929
01:09:36 --> 01:09:39
 and I burned it to ash. I burned it.
930
01:09:44 --> 01:09:46
 You're strong.
931
01:09:48 --> 01:09:49
 Me.
932
01:09:51 --> 01:09:53
 You're generous.
933
01:09:54 --> 01:09:55
 Me.
934
01:09:57 --> 01:10:00
 But I never taught you to lie.
935
01:10:00 --> 01:10:03
 That's why you're so bad at it.
936
01:10:05 --> 01:10:09
 Where is the Soul Stone?
937
01:10:27 --> 01:10:28
 Vormir!
938
01:10:46 --> 01:10:47
 The stone is on Vormir.
939
01:10:51 --> 01:10:53
 Show me.
940
01:10:55 --> 01:10:56
 I am Groot.
941
01:10:57 --> 01:10:59
 Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see?
942
01:10:59 --> 01:11:01
 What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig before.
943
01:11:02 --> 01:11:03
 I am Groot.
944
01:11:03 --> 01:11:05
 Tree, pour what's in the cup out into space and go in the cup again.
945
01:11:06 --> 01:11:07
 You speak Groot?
946
01:11:07 --> 01:11:09
 Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.
947
01:11:09 --> 01:11:10
 I am Groot.
948
01:11:10 --> 01:11:12
 You'll know when we're close.
949
01:11:12 --> 01:11:16
 Nidavellir's forge harnesses the blazing power of a neutron star.
950
01:11:19 --> 01:11:21
 It's the birthplace of my hammer.
951
01:11:22 --> 01:11:24
 It's truly awesome.
952
01:11:30 --> 01:11:33
 Okay, time to be the captain.
953
01:11:38 --> 01:11:39
 So, dead brother, huh?
954
01:11:40 --> 01:11:42
 Yeah, that could be annoying.
955
01:11:42 --> 01:11:44
 Well, he's been dead before.
956
01:11:46 --> 01:11:48
 But, no, this time I think it really might be true.
957
01:11:49 --> 01:11:51
 And you said your sister and your dad?
958
01:11:51 --> 01:11:53
 Both dead.
959
01:11:53 --> 01:11:55
 But still got a mom, though?
960
01:11:55 --> 01:11:57
 Killed by a dark elf.
961
01:11:57 --> 01:11:58
 A best friend?
962
01:11:58 --> 01:11:59
 Stabbed through the heart.
963
01:12:03 --> 01:12:06
 You sure you're up to this particular murder mission?
964
01:12:08 --> 01:12:09
 Absolutely.
965
01:12:10 --> 01:12:13
 Rage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret...
966
01:12:13 --> 01:12:16
 they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind.
967
01:12:16 --> 01:12:18
 So I'm good to go.
968
01:12:18 --> 01:12:21
 Yeah, but this Thanos we're talkin' about...
969
01:12:21 --> 01:12:23
 he's the toughest there is.
970
01:12:24 --> 01:12:26
 - Well, he's never fought me. - Yeah, he has.
971
01:12:26 --> 01:12:27
 He's never fought me twice.
972
01:12:28 --> 01:12:30
 And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.
973
01:12:30 --> 01:12:32
 It better be some hammer.
974
01:12:36 --> 01:12:39
 You know, I'm 1,500 years old.
975
01:12:39 --> 01:12:41
 I've killed twice as many enemies as that.
976
01:12:41 --> 01:12:44
 And every one of them would've rather killed me, but none succeeded.
977
01:12:45 --> 01:12:48
 I'm only alive because fate wants me alive.
978
01:12:48 --> 01:12:51
 Thanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards...
979
01:12:51 --> 01:12:53
 and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance.
980
01:12:53 --> 01:12:55
 Fate wills it so.
981
01:12:57 --> 01:12:58
 And what if you're wrong?
982
01:13:02 --> 01:13:03
 If I'm wrong, then...
983
01:13:05 --> 01:13:06
 what more could I lose?
984
01:13:20 --> 01:13:24
 I could lose a lot. Me, personally, I could lose a lot.
985
01:13:27 --> 01:13:28
 Okay.
986
01:13:32 --> 01:13:34
 If fate does want you to kill that crapsack...
987
01:13:34 --> 01:13:36
 you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.
988
01:13:36 --> 01:13:38
 - What's this? - What's it look like?
989
01:13:38 --> 01:13:40
 Some jerk lost a bet with me on Contraxia.
990
01:13:41 --> 01:13:42
 He gave you his eye?
991
01:13:42 --> 01:13:43
 No, he gave me 100 credits.
992
01:13:43 --> 01:13:46
 I snuck into his room later that night and stole his eye.
993
01:13:48 --> 01:13:49
 Thank you, sweet rabbit.
994
01:13:58 --> 01:13:59
 I would've washed that.
995
01:14:01 --> 01:14:03
 The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...
996
01:14:04 --> 01:14:05
 Hey, we're here!
997
01:14:09 --> 01:14:11
 I don't think this thing works.
998
01:14:11 --> 01:14:12
 Everything seems dark.
999
01:14:14 --> 01:14:16
 It ain't the eye.
1000
01:14:29 --> 01:14:31
 Something's wrong.
1001
01:14:32 --> 01:14:33
 The star's gone out.
1002
01:14:34 --> 01:14:36
 And the rings are frozen.
1003
01:14:57 --> 01:15:00
 I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning.
1004
01:15:05 --> 01:15:08
 Maybe they realized that they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.
1005
01:15:09 --> 01:15:11
 This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries.
1006
01:15:14 --> 01:15:16
 You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?
1007
01:15:17 --> 01:15:18
 Yes, why?
1008
01:15:18 --> 01:15:20
 It look anything like that?
1009
01:15:23 --> 01:15:25
 I am Groot.
1010
01:15:25 --> 01:15:27
 Go back to the pod.
1011
01:15:31 --> 01:15:32
 Eitri, wait!
1012
01:15:33 --> 01:15:34
 Stop!
1013
01:15:35 --> 01:15:36
 Stop.
1014
01:15:37 --> 01:15:37
 Thor?
1015
01:15:41 --> 01:15:42
 What happened here?
1016
01:15:43 --> 01:15:45
 You were supposed to protect us.
1017
01:15:46 --> 01:15:48
 Asgard was supposed to protect us.
1018
01:15:49 --> 01:15:51
 Asgard is destroyed.
1019
01:15:53 --> 01:15:57
 Eitri, the glove. What did you do?
1020
01:16:10 --> 01:16:13
 300 dwarves lived on this ring.
1021
01:16:14 --> 01:16:17
 I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe.
1022
01:16:19 --> 01:16:21
 I made what he wanted.
1023
01:16:23 --> 01:16:27
 A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones.
1024
01:16:32 --> 01:16:34
 Then he killed everyone anyway.
1025
01:16:36 --> 01:16:38
 All except me.
1026
01:16:39 --> 01:16:41
 "Your life is yours," he said.
1027
01:16:42 --> 01:16:46
 "But your hands are mine alone."
1028
01:16:47 --> 01:16:49
 Eitri, this isn't about your hands.
1029
01:16:50 --> 01:16:53
 Every weapon you've ever designed, every axe, hammer, sword...
1030
01:16:54 --> 01:16:56
 it's all inside your head.
1031
01:16:57 --> 01:16:59
 Now, I know it feels like all hope is lost.
1032
01:16:59 --> 01:17:00
 Trust me, I know.
1033
01:17:01 --> 01:17:05
 But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.
1034
01:17:46 --> 01:17:48
 Mantis, listen very carefully.
1035
01:17:48 --> 01:17:50
 I need you to meet me on Titan.
1036
01:17:57 --> 01:17:58
 Hey, what's going on?
1037
01:17:58 --> 01:18:00
 I think we're here.
1038
01:18:00 --> 01:18:02
 I don't think this rig has a self-park function.
1039
01:18:04 --> 01:18:07
 Get your hand inside the steering gimbal. Close those around it.
1040
01:18:08 --> 01:18:09
 - You understand? - Yep, got it.
1041
01:18:09 --> 01:18:11
 This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta move at the same time.
1042
01:18:12 --> 01:18:12
 Okay, okay. Ready.
1043
01:18:17 --> 01:18:18
 We might wanna turn.
1044
01:18:18 --> 01:18:20
 Turn! Turn! Turn!
1045
01:18:49 --> 01:18:51
 You all right?
1046
01:18:52 --> 01:18:54
 That was close.
1047
01:18:55 --> 01:18:56
 I owe you one.
1048
01:18:57 --> 01:19:01
 Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something...
1049
01:19:01 --> 01:19:02
 and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.
1050
01:19:02 --> 01:19:05
 I do not want another single pop culture reference
1051
01:19:05 --> 01:19:06
 out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?
1052
01:19:06 --> 01:19:08
 I'm trying to say that something is coming.
1053
01:19:15 --> 01:19:16
 Thanos!
1054
01:19:38 --> 01:19:39
 Please don't put your eggs in me!
1055
01:19:41 --> 01:19:43
 Stay down, clown.
1056
01:19:48 --> 01:19:50
 Die, blanket of death!
1057
01:19:56 --> 01:19:59
 Everybody stay where you are. Chill the eff out.
1058
01:20:00 --> 01:20:02
 I'm gonna ask you this one time.
1059
01:20:03 --> 01:20:04
 Where is Gamora?
1060
01:20:05 --> 01:20:07
 Yeah. I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?
1061
01:20:07 --> 01:20:10
 I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?
1062
01:20:10 --> 01:20:14
 Tell me where the girl is or I swear to you I'm gonna French fry this little freak.
1063
01:20:14 --> 01:20:17
 Let's do it. You shoot my guy and I'll blast him. Let's go!
1064
01:20:17 --> 01:20:20
 Do it, Quill! I can take it.
1065
01:20:20 --> 01:20:22
 - No, he can't take it! - She's right. You can't.
1066
01:20:22 --> 01:20:24
 Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine.
1067
01:20:24 --> 01:20:27
 I'll kill all three of you and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.
1068
01:20:27 --> 01:20:28
 Starting with you.
1069
01:20:29 --> 01:20:32
 Wait, what, Thanos? All right, let me ask you this one time.
1070
01:20:32 --> 01:20:34
 What master do you serve?
1071
01:20:34 --> 01:20:37
 What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say, "Jesus"?
1072
01:20:38 --> 01:20:40
 - You're from Earth. - I'm not from Earth, I'm from Missouri.
1073
01:20:40 --> 01:20:41
 Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.
1074
01:20:42 --> 01:20:43
 What are you hassling us for?
1075
01:20:43 --> 01:20:45
 So you're not with Thanos?
1076
01:20:45 --> 01:20:47
 With Thanos?
1077
01:20:47 --> 01:20:50
 No, I'm here to kill Thanos.
1078
01:20:50 --> 01:20:52
 He took my girl. Wait, who are you?
1079
01:20:53 --> 01:20:54
 We're the Avengers, man.
1080
01:20:54 --> 01:20:57
 You're the ones Thor told us about.
1081
01:20:57 --> 01:20:58
 You know Thor?
1082
01:20:58 --> 01:21:02
 Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving.
1083
01:21:02 --> 01:21:04
 Where is he now?
1084
01:21:19 --> 01:21:21
 This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?
1085
01:21:21 --> 01:21:22
 It's a mold.
1086
01:21:23 --> 01:21:24
 A king's weapon.
1087
01:21:25 --> 01:21:27
 Meant to be the greatest in Asgard.
1088
01:21:28 --> 01:21:31
 In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.
1089
01:21:31 --> 01:21:32
 Did it have a name?
1090
01:21:34 --> 01:21:35
 Stormbreaker.
1091
01:21:35 --> 01:21:36
 That's a bit much.
1092
01:21:38 --> 01:21:40
 So how do we make it?
1093
01:21:41 --> 01:21:44
 You'll have to restart the forge.
1094
01:21:45 --> 01:21:47
 Awaken the heart of a dying star.
1095
01:21:49 --> 01:21:52
 Rabbit, fire up the pod.
1096
01:21:56 --> 01:21:58
 The hell happened to this planet?
1097
01:21:58 --> 01:22:02
 It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.
1098
01:22:03 --> 01:22:06
 Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us.
1099
01:22:07 --> 01:22:10
 We'll use it. All right, I have a plan.
1100
01:22:10 --> 01:22:11
 Or at least the beginnings of one.
1101
01:22:11 --> 01:22:14
 It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need.
1102
01:22:14 --> 01:22:17
 Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.
1103
01:22:17 --> 01:22:18
 Are you yawning?
1104
01:22:20 --> 01:22:22
 In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down?
1105
01:22:22 --> 01:22:23
 Did you hear what I said?
1106
01:22:24 --> 01:22:26
 I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."
1107
01:22:26 --> 01:22:27
 Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.
1108
01:22:28 --> 01:22:30
 See, "not winging it" isn't really what they do.
1109
01:22:31 --> 01:22:32
 What exactly is it that they do?
1110
01:22:32 --> 01:22:35
 Kick names, take ass. Yeah, that's right.
1111
01:22:42 --> 01:22:43
 All right, just get over here, please.
1112
01:22:44 --> 01:22:46
 Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?
1113
01:22:46 --> 01:22:48
 "Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.
1114
01:22:51 --> 01:22:52
 We gotta coalesce.
1115
01:22:52 --> 01:22:54
 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude...
1116
01:22:54 --> 01:22:56
 Dude, don't call us plucky.
1117
01:22:56 --> 01:22:58
 We don't know what it means.
1118
01:22:58 --> 01:23:01
 All right, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan.
1119
01:23:01 --> 01:23:03
 Except it sucks, so let me do the plan...
1120
01:23:03 --> 01:23:05
 and that way it might be really good.
1121
01:23:05 --> 01:23:07
 Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.
1122
01:23:08 --> 01:23:09
 What dance-off?
1123
01:23:09 --> 01:23:10
 It's nothing.
1124
01:23:10 --> 01:23:11
 Like in Footloose, the movie?
1125
01:23:11 --> 01:23:12
 Exactly like Footloose.
1126
01:23:13 --> 01:23:15
 Is it still the greatest movie in history?
1127
01:23:15 --> 01:23:16
 It never was.
1128
01:23:16 --> 01:23:17
 - Don't encourage this, all right? - Okay.
1129
01:23:18 --> 01:23:19
 We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.
1130
01:23:19 --> 01:23:21
 Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment.
1131
01:23:22 --> 01:23:23
 Don't forget, I'm half human.
1132
01:23:24 --> 01:23:25
 So that 50% of me that's stupid...
1133
01:23:26 --> 01:23:27
 that's 100% you.
1134
01:23:27 --> 01:23:30
 - Your math is blowing my mind. - Excuse me.
1135
01:23:31 --> 01:23:35
 But does your friend often do that?
1136
01:23:36 --> 01:23:38
 Strange, we all right?
1137
01:23:48 --> 01:23:50
 - You're back. You're all right. - Hi.
1138
01:23:50 --> 01:23:51
 Hey, what was that?
1139
01:23:52 --> 01:23:56
 I went forward in time to view alternate futures.
1140
01:23:56 --> 01:24:00
 To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.
1141
01:24:01 --> 01:24:02
 How many did you see?
1142
01:24:02 --> 01:24:04
 14,000,605.
1143
01:24:06 --> 01:24:08
 How many did we win?
1144
01:24:12 --> 01:24:13
 One.
1145
01:24:35 --> 01:24:38
 The stone had better be up there.
1146
01:24:40 --> 01:24:42
 For your sister's sake.
1147
01:25:03 --> 01:25:08
 Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.
1148
01:25:10 --> 01:25:13
 Gamora, daughter of Thanos.
1149
01:25:13 --> 01:25:15
 You know us?
1150
01:25:15 --> 01:25:19
 It is my curse to know all who journey here.
1151
01:25:20 --> 01:25:22
 Where is the Soul Stone?
1152
01:25:22 --> 01:25:24
 You should know...
1153
01:25:25 --> 01:25:28
 it extracts a terrible price.
1154
01:25:29 --> 01:25:31
 I am prepared.
1155
01:25:33 --> 01:25:35
 We all think that at first.
1156
01:25:40 --> 01:25:42
 We are all wrong.
1157
01:25:54 --> 01:25:56
 How is it you know this place so well?
1158
01:25:56 --> 01:26:01
 A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones.
1159
01:26:01 --> 01:26:04
 I even held one in my hand.
1160
01:26:04 --> 01:26:08
 But it cast me out, banished me here.
1161
01:26:08 --> 01:26:12
 Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.
1162
01:26:21 --> 01:26:24
 What you seek lies in front of you.
1163
01:26:25 --> 01:26:27
 As does what you fear.
1164
01:26:28 --> 01:26:29
 What's this?
1165
01:26:30 --> 01:26:31
 The price.
1166
01:26:31 --> 01:26:36
 Soul holds a special place among the Infinity Stones.
1167
01:26:37 --> 01:26:41
 You might say it has a certain wisdom.
1168
01:26:43 --> 01:26:44
 Tell me what it needs.
1169
01:26:45 --> 01:26:48
 To ensure that whoever possesses it...
1170
01:26:48 --> 01:26:51
 understands its power...
1171
01:26:52 --> 01:26:56
 the stone demands a sacrifice.
1172
01:26:56 --> 01:26:57
 Of what?
1173
01:26:58 --> 01:27:02
 In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love.
1174
01:27:05 --> 01:27:06
 A soul...
1175
01:27:07 --> 01:27:08
 for a soul.
1176
01:27:24 --> 01:27:26
 All my life, I dreamed of a day...
1177
01:27:27 --> 01:27:29
 a moment...
1178
01:27:30 --> 01:27:32
 when you got what you deserved.
1179
01:27:34 --> 01:27:37
 And I was always so disappointed.
1180
01:27:40 --> 01:27:42
 But now...
1181
01:27:46 --> 01:27:49
 You kill and torture...
1182
01:27:51 --> 01:27:53
 and you call it mercy.
1183
01:27:57 --> 01:27:59
 The universe has judged you.
1184
01:28:00 --> 01:28:05
 You asked it for a prize, and it told you no.
1185
01:28:06 --> 01:28:08
 You failed.
1186
01:28:09 --> 01:28:11
 And do you wanna know why?
1187
01:28:12 --> 01:28:14
 Because you love nothing.
1188
01:28:15 --> 01:28:16
 No one.
1189
01:28:22 --> 01:28:23
 No.
1190
01:28:28 --> 01:28:29
 Really?
1191
01:28:30 --> 01:28:31
 Tears?
1192
01:28:32 --> 01:28:34
 They're not for him.
1193
01:28:48 --> 01:28:49
 No.
1194
01:28:51 --> 01:28:52
 This isn't love.
1195
01:28:53 --> 01:28:56
 I ignored my destiny once.
1196
01:28:58 --> 01:29:00
 I cannot do that again.
1197
01:29:01 --> 01:29:04
 Even for you.
1198
01:29:28 --> 01:29:31
 I'm sorry, little one.
1199
01:29:34 --> 01:29:36
 No!
1200
01:31:13 --> 01:31:16
 Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.
1201
01:31:16 --> 01:31:18
 I hope you're right about this.
1202
01:31:18 --> 01:31:21
 Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.
1203
01:31:36 --> 01:31:39
 When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world...
1204
01:31:39 --> 01:31:41
 this is not what I imagined.
1205
01:31:41 --> 01:31:43
 And what did you imagine?
1206
01:31:44 --> 01:31:45
 The Olympics.
1207
01:31:45 --> 01:31:47
 Maybe even a Starbucks.
1208
01:32:01 --> 01:32:02
 Should we bow?
1209
01:32:02 --> 01:32:04
 Yeah, he's a king.
1210
01:32:04 --> 01:32:06
 Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.
1211
01:32:08 --> 01:32:09
 What are you doing?
1212
01:32:10 --> 01:32:11
 We don't do that here.
1213
01:32:11 --> 01:32:14
 So how big of an assault should we expect?
1214
01:32:14 --> 01:32:17
 Sir, I think you should expect quite a big assault.
1215
01:32:17 --> 01:32:18
 How we looking?
1216
01:32:18 --> 01:32:23
 You will have my Kingsguard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...
1217
01:32:24 --> 01:32:27
 And a semi-stable 100-year-old man.
1218
01:32:30 --> 01:32:31
 How you been, Buck?
1219
01:32:31 --> 01:32:34
 Not bad, for the end of the world.
1220
01:32:48 --> 01:32:50
 The structure is polymorphic.
1221
01:32:50 --> 01:32:53
 Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.
1222
01:32:53 --> 01:32:57
 Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?
1223
01:32:59 --> 01:33:02
 Because we didn't think of it.
1224
01:33:02 --> 01:33:04
 I'm sure you did your best.
1225
01:33:04 --> 01:33:05
 Can you do it?
1226
01:33:06 --> 01:33:09
 Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here.
1227
01:33:09 --> 01:33:12
 One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.
1228
01:33:13 --> 01:33:14
 It will take time, brother.
1229
01:33:16 --> 01:33:17
 How long?
1230
01:33:17 --> 01:33:18
 As long as you can give me.
1231
01:33:23 --> 01:33:25
 Something's entered the atmosphere.
1232
01:33:42 --> 01:33:44
 Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.
1233
01:33:54 --> 01:33:55
 God, I love this place.
1234
01:33:56 --> 01:33:59
 Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome.
1235
01:34:19 --> 01:34:19
 It's too late.
1236
01:34:21 --> 01:34:22
 We need to destroy the stone now.
1237
01:34:22 --> 01:34:24
 Vision, get your ass back on the table.
1238
01:34:24 --> 01:34:26
 We will hold them off.
1239
01:34:26 --> 01:34:29
 Wanda, as soon as that stone's out of his head...
1240
01:34:29 --> 01:34:30
 you blow it to hell.
1241
01:34:31 --> 01:34:32
 I will.
1242
01:34:32 --> 01:34:35
 Evacuate the city. Engage all defenses.
1243
01:34:35 --> 01:34:37
 And get this man a shield.
1244
01:34:47 --> 01:34:50
 I don't think you get the scientifics here.
1245
01:34:50 --> 01:34:52
 These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving...
1246
01:34:52 --> 01:34:55
 you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.
1247
01:34:55 --> 01:34:57
 - Leave that to me. - Leave it to you?
1248
01:34:57 --> 01:35:00
 Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a...
1249
01:35:09 --> 01:35:10
 Fire the engines!
1250
01:35:27 --> 01:35:30
 More power, rabbit!
1251
01:36:02 --> 01:36:03
 Well done, boy.
1252
01:36:05 --> 01:36:07
 That's Nidavellir.
1253
01:36:27 --> 01:36:28
 Damn it.
1254
01:36:29 --> 01:36:30
 "Damn it"? What's "damn it"?
1255
01:36:30 --> 01:36:32
 - The mechanism is crippled. - What?
1256
01:36:32 --> 01:36:34
 With the iris closed, I can't heat the metal.
1257
01:36:34 --> 01:36:36
 How long will it take to heat it?
1258
01:36:36 --> 01:36:39
 A few minutes, maybe more. Why?
1259
01:36:41 --> 01:36:42
 I'm gonna hold it open.
1260
01:36:42 --> 01:36:43
 That's suicide.
1261
01:36:43 --> 01:36:46
 So is facing Thanos without that axe.
1262
01:36:55 --> 01:36:56
 How we looking, Bruce?
1263
01:36:57 --> 01:36:58
 Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.
1264
01:37:02 --> 01:37:06
 This is amazing, man. It's like being the Hulk without actually...
1265
01:37:09 --> 01:37:12
 I'm okay. I'm okay.
1266
01:37:13 --> 01:37:15
 I've got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.
1267
01:37:44 --> 01:37:46
 Thank you for standing with us.
1268
01:38:08 --> 01:38:09
 Where's your other friend?
1269
01:38:10 --> 01:38:13
 You will pay for his life with yours.
1270
01:38:14 --> 01:38:16
 Thanos will have that stone.
1271
01:38:17 --> 01:38:18
 That's not gonna happen.
1272
01:38:18 --> 01:38:20
 You are in Wakanda now.
1273
01:38:21 --> 01:38:24
 Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.
1274
01:38:27 --> 01:38:29
 We have blood to spare.
1275
01:38:41 --> 01:38:42
 They surrender?
1276
01:38:43 --> 01:38:44
 Not exactly.
1277
01:39:11 --> 01:39:12
 What the hell?
1278
01:39:15 --> 01:39:17
 Looks like we pissed her off.
1279
01:39:28 --> 01:39:29
 They're killing themselves.
1280
01:40:06 --> 01:40:07
 You see the teeth on those things?
1281
01:40:07 --> 01:40:09
 All right, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed.
1282
01:40:22 --> 01:40:24
 Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us...
1283
01:40:25 --> 01:40:26
 there's nothing between them and Vision.
1284
01:40:27 --> 01:40:28
 Then we better keep 'em in front of us.
1285
01:40:29 --> 01:40:30
 How do we do that?
1286
01:40:32 --> 01:40:34
 We open the barrier.
1287
01:40:36 --> 01:40:40
 On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.
1288
01:40:41 --> 01:40:44
 Requesting confirmation, My King. You said open the barrier?
1289
01:40:45 --> 01:40:46
 On my signal.
1290
01:40:46 --> 01:40:48
 This will be the end of Wakanda.
1291
01:40:49 --> 01:40:53
 Then it will be the noblest ending in history.
1292
01:41:05 --> 01:41:07
 Wakanda forever!
1293
01:41:20 --> 01:41:21
 Now!
1294
01:41:51 --> 01:41:52
 How much longer, Shuri?
1295
01:41:52 --> 01:41:54
 I've barely begun, brother.
1296
01:41:54 --> 01:41:56
 You might want to pick up the pace.
1297
01:42:03 --> 01:42:05
 Allfathers, give me strength.
1298
01:42:05 --> 01:42:07
 You understand, boy?
1299
01:42:07 --> 01:42:10
 You're about to take the full force of a star.
1300
01:42:11 --> 01:42:12
 It'll kill you.
1301
01:42:13 --> 01:42:15
 Only if I die.
1302
01:42:16 --> 01:42:17
 Yes.
1303
01:42:17 --> 01:42:20
 That's what killing you means.
1304
01:42:48 --> 01:42:50
 Hold it! Hold it, Thor!
1305
01:43:40 --> 01:43:42
 Thor! Say something. Come on.
1306
01:43:43 --> 01:43:44
 Thor, you okay?
1307
01:43:50 --> 01:43:51
 I think he's dying.
1308
01:43:51 --> 01:43:53
 He needs the axe!
1309
01:43:55 --> 01:43:56
 Where's the handle?
1310
01:43:59 --> 01:44:01
 Tree, help me find the handle!
1311
01:45:10 --> 01:45:12
 There's too many of 'em!
1312
01:45:40 --> 01:45:42
 You guys are so screwed now!
1313
01:45:46 --> 01:45:48
 Bring me Thanos!
1314
01:46:20 --> 01:46:22
 Oh, yeah.
1315
01:46:25 --> 01:46:27
 You're much more of a Thanos.
1316
01:46:29 --> 01:46:31
 I take it the Maw is dead.
1317
01:46:34 --> 01:46:36
 This day extracts a heavy toll.
1318
01:46:38 --> 01:46:40
 Still, he accomplished his mission.
1319
01:46:41 --> 01:46:42
 You may regret that.
1320
01:46:43 --> 01:46:46
 He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.
1321
01:46:49 --> 01:46:51
 And where do you think he brought you?
1322
01:46:53 --> 01:46:55
 Let me guess. Your home?
1323
01:47:00 --> 01:47:01
 It was.
1324
01:47:04 --> 01:47:05
 And it was beautiful.
1325
01:47:08 --> 01:47:10
 Titan was like most planets.
1326
01:47:10 --> 01:47:13
 Too many mouths, not enough to go around.
1327
01:47:13 --> 01:47:17
 And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.
1328
01:47:18 --> 01:47:19
 Genocide.
1329
01:47:20 --> 01:47:24
 But random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike.
1330
01:47:25 --> 01:47:27
 They called me a madman.
1331
01:47:28 --> 01:47:30
 And what I predicted came to pass.
1332
01:47:33 --> 01:47:35
 Congratulations, you're a prophet.
1333
01:47:35 --> 01:47:37
 I'm a survivor.
1334
01:47:37 --> 01:47:39
 Who wants to murder trillions.
1335
01:47:39 --> 01:47:43
 With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers.
1336
01:47:43 --> 01:47:48
 They would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.
1337
01:47:50 --> 01:47:52
 And then what?
1338
01:47:53 --> 01:47:55
 I'd finally rest...
1339
01:47:55 --> 01:47:58
 and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.
1340
01:48:00 --> 01:48:03
 The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
1341
01:48:04 --> 01:48:09
 I think you'll find our will equal to yours.
1342
01:48:10 --> 01:48:11
 Our?
1343
01:48:17 --> 01:48:19
 Piece of cake, Quill.
1344
01:48:19 --> 01:48:21
 Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.
1345
01:48:59 --> 01:49:00
 Boom!
1346
01:49:02 --> 01:49:03
 Don't let him close his fist.
1347
01:49:08 --> 01:49:10
 Magic. More magic.
1348
01:49:11 --> 01:49:12
 Magic with a kick.
1349
01:49:13 --> 01:49:14
 Magic with a...
1350
01:49:15 --> 01:49:16
 Insect!
1351
01:49:54 --> 01:49:55
 Well, well.
1352
01:49:55 --> 01:49:56
 You should've killed me.
1353
01:49:56 --> 01:49:58
 It would've been a waste of parts!
1354
01:50:04 --> 01:50:05
 Where's Gamora?
1355
01:50:46 --> 01:50:50
 - Is he under? Don't let up. - Be quick. He is very strong.
1356
01:50:50 --> 01:50:52
 Parker, help! Get over here.
1357
01:50:52 --> 01:50:55
 She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.
1358
01:51:00 --> 01:51:01
 We gotta open his fingers to get it off.
1359
01:51:01 --> 01:51:04
 I thought you'd be hard to catch. For the record, this was my plan.
1360
01:51:05 --> 01:51:09
 You're not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?
1361
01:51:10 --> 01:51:13
 - My Gamora. - No, bullshit!
1362
01:51:13 --> 01:51:15
 Where is she?
1363
01:51:16 --> 01:51:17
 He is in anguish.
1364
01:51:18 --> 01:51:19
 Good.
1365
01:51:21 --> 01:51:22
 He mourns.
1366
01:51:23 --> 01:51:26
 What does this monster have to mourn?
1367
01:51:27 --> 01:51:28
 Gamora.
1368
01:51:32 --> 01:51:33
 What?
1369
01:51:34 --> 01:51:35
 He took her to Vormir.
1370
01:51:36 --> 01:51:38
 He came back with the Soul Stone.
1371
01:51:38 --> 01:51:40
 But she didn't.
1372
01:51:42 --> 01:51:45
 Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now. You understand?
1373
01:51:46 --> 01:51:49
 Don't, don't. Don't engage. We almost got this off!
1374
01:51:51 --> 01:51:52
 Tell me she's lying.
1375
01:51:54 --> 01:51:57
 Asshole, tell me you didn't do it!
1376
01:51:58 --> 01:52:02
 I had to.
1377
01:52:02 --> 01:52:04
 No, you didn't.
1378
01:52:04 --> 01:52:06
 No, you didn't.
1379
01:52:10 --> 01:52:11
 - No, you didn't! - Quill!
1380
01:52:11 --> 01:52:13
 Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop!
1381
01:52:14 --> 01:52:17
 - Hey, stop! Stop! - It's coming, it's coming. I got it, I got it!
1382
01:52:20 --> 01:52:21
 Oh, God.
1383
01:53:20 --> 01:53:23
 Come and get some, space dogs!
1384
01:53:26 --> 01:53:29
 Come on! Get some! Get some!
1385
01:53:29 --> 01:53:31
 Come on! Get some!
1386
01:53:31 --> 01:53:33
 - How much for the gun? - Not for sale.
1387
01:53:34 --> 01:53:36
 Okay. How much for the arm?
1388
01:53:37 --> 01:53:39
 Oh, I'll get that arm.
1389
01:53:48 --> 01:53:49
 New haircut?
1390
01:53:50 --> 01:53:51
 Noticed you've copied my beard.
1391
01:53:54 --> 01:53:55
 By the way, this is a friend of mine, Tree.
1392
01:53:56 --> 01:53:58
 I am Groot.
1393
01:53:59 --> 01:54:01
 I am Steve Rogers.
1394
01:54:21 --> 01:54:23
 Fall back! Fall back, now!
1395
01:54:32 --> 01:54:34
 Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.
1396
01:54:35 --> 01:54:36
 I'm doing it.
1397
01:55:00 --> 01:55:01
 Why was she up there all this time?
1398
01:55:02 --> 01:55:05
 She's on the field. Take it.
1399
01:55:37 --> 01:55:39
 Guys, we got a Vision situation here.
1400
01:55:42 --> 01:55:43
 Somebody get to Vision!
1401
01:55:44 --> 01:55:45
 I got him!
1402
01:55:45 --> 01:55:46
 On my way.
1403
01:55:51 --> 01:55:54
 He'll die alone. As will you.
1404
01:55:54 --> 01:55:55
 She's not alone.
1405
01:56:21 --> 01:56:23
 Oh, no, you don't.
1406
01:56:23 --> 01:56:25
 This isn't gonna be like New York, pal.
1407
01:56:25 --> 01:56:27
 This suit's already kicked the crap outta the Hulk.
1408
01:56:27 --> 01:56:28
 What? No! No!
1409
01:56:32 --> 01:56:35
 Guys! Vision needs backup, now!
1410
01:56:37 --> 01:56:40
 Hulk? Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second.
1411
01:56:41 --> 01:56:43
 Well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second.
1412
01:56:48 --> 01:56:49
 Hulk! Hulk!
1413
01:56:50 --> 01:56:51
 Hulk!
1414
01:56:52 --> 01:56:54
 No!
1415
01:56:55 --> 01:56:57
 Oh, screw you, you big, green asshole!
1416
01:56:58 --> 01:56:59
 I'll do it myself!
1417
01:57:00 --> 01:57:02
 Come on! Yeah!
1418
01:57:14 --> 01:57:15
 See ya!
1419
01:57:27 --> 01:57:30
 Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.
1420
01:57:41 --> 01:57:42
 I thought you were formidable, machine.
1421
01:57:43 --> 01:57:46
 But you're dying, like any man.
1422
01:57:55 --> 01:57:56
 Get outta here!
1423
01:57:59 --> 01:58:00
 Go!
1424
01:58:19 --> 01:58:21
 That was really gross.
1425
01:58:48 --> 01:58:49
 I thought I told you to go.
1426
01:58:50 --> 01:58:52
 We don't trade lives, Captain.
1427
01:59:04 --> 01:59:06
 I got you. I got you.
1428
01:59:06 --> 01:59:08
 I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names.
1429
01:59:53 --> 01:59:55
 You're full of tricks, wizard.
1430
01:59:57 --> 02:00:00
 Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.
1431
02:00:03 --> 02:00:04
 A fake.
1432
02:00:12 --> 02:00:16
 You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna lose it.
1433
02:00:16 --> 02:00:17
 Stark.
1434
02:00:17 --> 02:00:18
 You know me?
1435
02:00:19 --> 02:00:20
 I do.
1436
02:00:20 --> 02:00:24
 You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.
1437
02:00:25 --> 02:00:26
 My only curse is you.
1438
02:00:28 --> 02:00:30
 Come on!
1439
02:00:57 --> 02:00:59
 All that for a drop of blood.
1440
02:01:43 --> 02:01:45
 You have my respect, Stark.
1441
02:01:47 --> 02:01:50
 When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive.
1442
02:01:56 --> 02:01:58
 I hope they remember you.
1443
02:02:08 --> 02:02:09
 Stop.
1444
02:02:15 --> 02:02:16
 Spare his life...
1445
02:02:18 --> 02:02:19
 and I will give you the stone.
1446
02:02:23 --> 02:02:24
 No tricks.
1447
02:02:29 --> 02:02:30
 Don't.
1448
02:03:21 --> 02:03:23
 One to go.
1449
02:03:33 --> 02:03:35
 Where is he?
1450
02:03:43 --> 02:03:45
 Did we just lose?
1451
02:03:49 --> 02:03:51
 Why would you do that?
1452
02:03:54 --> 02:03:56
 We're in the endgame now.
1453
02:04:22 --> 02:04:24
 Are you okay?
1454
02:04:26 --> 02:04:27
 What? What is it?
1455
02:04:29 --> 02:04:31
 He's here.
1456
02:04:42 --> 02:04:45
 Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.
1457
02:04:47 --> 02:04:49
 What the hell?
1458
02:05:15 --> 02:05:16
 Cap.
1459
02:05:17 --> 02:05:18
 That's him.
1460
02:05:20 --> 02:05:23
 Eyes up. Stay sharp.
1461
02:05:47 --> 02:05:48
 Wanda.
1462
02:05:49 --> 02:05:52
 - It's time. - No.
1463
02:05:52 --> 02:05:54
 They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can.
1464
02:05:54 --> 02:05:57
 Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone.
1465
02:05:57 --> 02:05:59
 - Don't. - You must do it. Wanda, please.
1466
02:06:01 --> 02:06:04
 We are out of time.
1467
02:06:05 --> 02:06:06
 I can't.
1468
02:06:06 --> 02:06:07
 Yes, you can.
1469
02:06:08 --> 02:06:09
 You can.
1470
02:06:11 --> 02:06:13
 If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.
1471
02:06:16 --> 02:06:17
 It's not fair.
1472
02:06:18 --> 02:06:20
 It shouldn't be you, but it is.
1473
02:06:22 --> 02:06:23
 It's all right.
1474
02:06:25 --> 02:06:26
 You could never hurt me.
1475
02:06:35 --> 02:06:37
 I just feel you.
1476
02:08:00 --> 02:08:01
 It's all right.
1477
02:08:11 --> 02:08:13
 It's all right.
1478
02:08:17 --> 02:08:18
 I love you.
1479
02:08:47 --> 02:08:50
 I understand, my child.
1480
02:08:51 --> 02:08:53
 Better than anyone.
1481
02:08:54 --> 02:08:56
 You could never.
1482
02:09:01 --> 02:09:04
 Today, I lost more than you can know.
1483
02:09:06 --> 02:09:09
 But now is no time to mourn.
1484
02:09:11 --> 02:09:15
 Now is no time at all.
1485
02:09:38 --> 02:09:39
 No!
1486
02:10:37 --> 02:10:39
 I told you...
1487
02:10:40 --> 02:10:42
 you'd die for that.
1488
02:10:56 --> 02:10:58
 You should have...
1489
02:11:01 --> 02:11:02
 You should...
1490
02:11:05 --> 02:11:08
 You should have gone for the head.
1491
02:11:10 --> 02:11:11
 No!
1492
02:11:44 --> 02:11:45
 Daughter?
1493
02:11:53 --> 02:11:54
 Did you do it?
1494
02:11:56 --> 02:11:57
 Yes.
1495
02:12:06 --> 02:12:07
 What did it cost?
1496
02:12:11 --> 02:12:12
 Everything.
1497
02:12:23 --> 02:12:24
 What did you do?
1498
02:12:26 --> 02:12:27
 What'd you do?
1499
02:12:41 --> 02:12:42
 Where'd he go?
1500
02:12:45 --> 02:12:46
 Thor.
1501
02:12:49 --> 02:12:51
 Where'd he go?
1502
02:12:51 --> 02:12:52
 Steve?
1503
02:13:27 --> 02:13:30
 Up, General. Up!
1504
02:13:30 --> 02:13:32
 This is no place to die.
1505
02:13:47 --> 02:13:48
 I am Groot.
1506
02:13:51 --> 02:13:53
 No, no, no!
1507
02:13:54 --> 02:13:56
 Groot! No.
1508
02:14:10 --> 02:14:11
 Sam!
1509
02:14:15 --> 02:14:17
 Sam, where you at?
1510
02:14:26 --> 02:14:28
 Something's happening.
1511
02:14:40 --> 02:14:42
 Quill?
1512
02:14:49 --> 02:14:50
 Steady, Quill.
1513
02:14:50 --> 02:14:51
 Oh, man.
1514
02:14:56 --> 02:14:57
 Tony.
1515
02:15:00 --> 02:15:03
 There was no other way.
1516
02:15:08 --> 02:15:09
 Mr. Stark?
1517
02:15:14 --> 02:15:15
 I don't feel so good.
1518
02:15:17 --> 02:15:19
 - You're all right. - I don't know what's happening.
1519
02:15:19 --> 02:15:20
 I don't know...
1520
02:15:23 --> 02:15:26
 I don't want to go. I don't want to go, sir. Please.
1521
02:15:26 --> 02:15:28
 Please, I don't want to go. I don't want to go.
1522
02:15:33 --> 02:15:34
 I'm sorry.
1523
02:15:49 --> 02:15:51
 He did it.
1524
02:16:16 --> 02:16:19
 What is this? What the hell is happening?
1525
02:16:20 --> 02:16:35

1526
02:16:36 --> 02:16:37
 Oh, God.
1527
02:27:34 --> 02:27:35
 Still no word from Stark?
1528
02:27:35 --> 02:27:36
 No, not yet.
1529
02:27:37 --> 02:27:40
 We're watching every satellite on both hemispheres, but still nothing.
1530
02:27:41 --> 02:27:42
 What is it?
1531
02:27:42 --> 02:27:44
 Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.
1532
02:27:45 --> 02:27:46
 Same energy signature as New York?
1533
02:27:47 --> 02:27:48
 Ten times bigger.
1534
02:27:49 --> 02:27:51
 - Tell Klein we'll meet him at... - Nick! Nick!
1535
02:28:05 --> 02:28:07
 They okay?
1536
02:28:08 --> 02:28:09
 There's no one here.
1537
02:28:19 --> 02:28:20
 Call Control.
1538
02:28:21 --> 02:28:23
 Code red.
1539
02:28:23 --> 02:28:24
 Nick.
1540
02:28:26 --> 02:28:27
 Hill.
1541
02:28:42 --> 02:28:43
 Oh, no.
1542
02:28:45 --> 02:28:46
 Mother...
